# Dining Philosophers
An object-oriented concurrent implementation of the dining philosophers problem simulating a restaurant scenario involving philosophers and tables with chopsticks that are shared between the philosophers! Governed by a simulation clock, this simulation utilizes locks and conditions for synchronization. The simulation runs until a deadlock occurs at the last table. During each iteration, the clock advances, and deadlock detection is performed. If deadlock is detected at any table except the last one, the philosopher causing the deadlock is moved to the last table. Finally, the ID of the last philosopher moved to the last table and the running time before deadlock at the last table are printed.
